# Notes

## Golang

1. Strongly typed - int will always be an int for the life of the program
2. Structs, Pointers, Methods
3. Explicit Error Handling
4. Multi-Threaded (good for multi-tasking) uses Concurrency, Goroutines, Sync
5. Strong opinions -conventions, built in tooling and linters

## Javascript

1. Dynamically typed.
2. ES6 Classes (kind of)
3. Errors are built in
4. Single-Threaded (callbacks, async await to help try alleviate multi-tasking)
5. Fluid opinions - Subjected to your mood
